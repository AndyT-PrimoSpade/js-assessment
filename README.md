## Reflection

**What did you like about this project?**
It is very hard but was very fun when completed

**What did you struggle with in this project?**
1st struggle during the start of the project as I have a idea but not sure where to start.
2nd struggle was creating the holes and the hat without overlaps.

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
More detail steps on what to do 1st and follows. 
Self-improvement: Need to improve steps with my logic & how to add feature that can make game 100% non-blockage.
